        <h2>Deadpool aka "The Merc with a Mouth"</h2>
       
        <p>Deadpool or real name Wade Winston Wilson is something of an anti-hero and a 
        mercenary created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza that is know for being a 
        excellent marksman he has the mutant ability of accelerated healing factor which 
        was given to him after undergoing the Weapon X program this enables him to 
        regenerate any destroyed tissue at a super-human rate as well as making him 
        immune to all known diseases. Because he had cancerous tumors he was suffering 
        from at the time of the Weapon X, program causing them to quickly spread across 
        his entire body. Because of this, his healing factor accelerated his cancer, 
        resulting in massive scars causing his appearance to be severely disfigured and 
        one of the reason for the complete body suite. Because of his big mouth and flashy 
        attitude he has been giving the nickname<span>"Merc with a Mouth".</span></p>
